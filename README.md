# 🧠 XRConnect+  
### 🎓 A University of Miami Senior Design Project  
**Made by:** Andrew Lamazares, Nate Joseph, and Youssof Alwardany  

> A culmination of four rigorous years at the University of Miami's prestigious College of Engineering.

## 🌐 What is XRConnect+?

**XRConnect+** is a platform that bridges **extended reality (XR)** with the **physical world** by enabling real-time interaction with smart devices — all from within a head-mounted display (HMD).

Through **HTTP communication**, XRConnect+ detects devices that a developer has **pre-programmed into their XR application** and establishes live connections. Once connected, the user can control and interact with these devices *directly within the XR environment*, according to the scope and behavior the developer defined.

## 🎮 Senior Design Expo Demo

To showcase XRConnect+ at the **University of Miami Senior Design Expo**, we built three fully functional demo use cases:

1. 💡 **Smart Light Control**  
   Users could turn lights on and off and change their color through gaze-based or hand-tracked interaction inside the headset.

2. 🚗 **RC Car with Live Camera Feed**  
   Users could remotely drive an RC car while viewing a **real-time video stream** from the car's front-facing camera inside the XR space.

3. 🎵 **Alexa Voice Integration**  
   Users could activate an Alexa device to play music in the room through contextual interactions in the virtual environment.

> These examples demonstrated XRConnect+'s flexibility and potential for smart home, accessibility, and entertainment applications — even in a constrained demo setting.

## 💡 Why We Built It

We believe that **head-mounted displays (HMDs)** will soon become an integral part of everyday life. As their form factor continues to shrink — possibly resembling the **Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses** — people will start using them not just for entertainment, but for **real-world control, accessibility, and productivity**.

In this future, XR will go beyond simulation — it will **seamlessly interface with our physical environment**. Imagine:

- Looking through your smart glasses at a virtual screen  
- Turning off all the lights in your home  
- Adjusting the thermostat  
- Starting music or locking your doors  
— all without lifting a finger.

We also see massive potential in **assistive applications**. For example, individuals with mobility impairments could use XRConnect+ to control a **helper robot** in their home — and **see through its eyes** as if it were their own. This concept was directly reflected in our Expo demo, where users drove a remote-controlled car and viewed a **real-time video feed** through their HMD — showcasing the very same principle of **remote embodiment** through XR.

That’s the future we’re building toward. **XRConnect+** is our step in merging extended reality with everyday utility — accessible, immersive, and empowering.
