## 🌐 What is XRConnect+?

**XRConnect+** is a powerful bridge between **extended reality (XR)** and the **real physical environment**. It empowers developers to connect XR applications with smart devices on a local network, enabling more immersive, reactive, and context-aware experiences.

Whether it's enhancing a horror game by syncing the in-game environment with real-world effects (like lowering the room’s temperature) or enabling accessibility features for users with disabilities, XRConnect+ aims to make XR not just virtual — but truly interactive with the world around you.

## 🔧 Key Features

- 🧠 **Local Smart Device Control**  
  Discover and control devices like smart lights, thermostats, and robots via your XR headset.

- 🎮 **Immersive Gaming Enhancements**  
  Sync game events with real-world effects (e.g., horror game lowers room temp or flickers lights).

- ♿ **Accessibility Use-Cases**  
  Allow individuals with mobility impairments to control assistive robots or devices via their headset.

- 🛠️ **Developer-Friendly**  
  Expose easy-to-use APIs and interfaces for integrating into Unity, Unreal Engine, and other platforms.

---

## 💡 Motivation

As XR technology evolves, the boundary between the digital and physical world becomes more blurred. We wanted to explore how **real-world feedback loops** can enrich immersion, utility, and emotional connection in XR — whether in games, therapy, education, or everyday life.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Networking & Device Control)
- Unity (XR development)
- Android XR SDK (Meta Quest compatibility)
- WebSocket Protocol
- Local Network Discovery (e.g., mDNS / Bonjour)

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- 🔐 Add secure device authentication
- ☁️ Expand to remote (non-local) IoT integration
- 📱 Create a companion mobile app
- 🎯 Publish as an SDK or Unity package
